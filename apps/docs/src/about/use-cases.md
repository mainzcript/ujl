# Use Cases

UJL delivers the most structural value where content is regularly maintained, multiple roles are involved, and quality needs to be reliably enforced over time. The following scenarios describe where classical visual editors hit their conceptual limits, and how UJL addresses them.

## Web Agencies with Editorially Maintained Client Projects

**The situation:** Agencies build websites for clients who then maintain content themselves. As soon as clients get access to visual editors or free design controls, the risk of brand drift increases, inconsistent layouts, incorrect contrast, broken semantics. The agency ends up responsible anyway, either through support costs or reputational risk.

**How UJL helps:** UJL is integrated as a visual layout layer. The agency defines modules, variants, and the theme so that editors can compose content freely within guardrails, without being able to violate the design system or basic accessibility rules.

**Benefit:** A durable quality framework that's enforced by the system, not by training or process. Content can be maintained autonomously without triggering repeated review and repair cycles.

## Marketing Teams Under Publication Pressure

**The situation:** Marketing teams create and update landing pages, product pages, and campaign content constantly. The pressure is high, timelines are short, and the tooling often forces a choice between speed and consistency.

**How UJL helps:** UJL enables fast visual authoring within defined guardrails. Marketing can create, iterate, and publish without needing free CSS/HTML access. Design rules, component variants, and accessibility requirements are baked in.

**Benefit:** Speed and stability combined. Content can be produced quickly without requiring design or development review on every change.

## Organizations with Accessibility and Compliance Requirements

**The situation:** Many organizations face increasing requirements around web accessibility and content quality. Accessibility is typically checked at the end of a project, through audits or manual reviews, making corrections expensive and risks persistent.

**How UJL helps:** UJL moves fundamental accessibility and structural constraints into the technical architecture. Editors can create and maintain content, but cannot produce output that violates defined standards, as long as those standards are correctly configured in the theme and modules.

**Benefit:** Predictable quality, reduced dependency on retrospective audits. Accessibility becomes a property of the authoring process, not a post-launch checklist.

## SaaS Products with an Embedded Editor (White-Label)

**The situation:** Many SaaS products need a visual authoring component, for landing pages, templates, knowledge bases, or structured content. Building one in-house is expensive and creates long-term maintenance obligations. And once end users can design freely, enforcing brand rules and layout consistency becomes its own problem.

**How UJL helps:** UJL can be embedded as a white-label editor. The SaaS product controls modules, themes, and governance rules; end users work within those boundaries. The editor becomes a product-ready component controlled through structured data and validation.

**Benefit:** Development time saved, technical debt avoided. Governance doesn't need to be bolted on through custom code or complex workflows. Content quality and consistency scale with the product.

## AI-Assisted Content Creation with Governance

**The situation:** AI is increasingly used to create or vary content faster. But AI amplifies the governance problem: generated content is often inconsistent and unreliable, and even good models need repeated prompt context to stay within brand rules.

**How UJL helps:** UJL integrates AI where it makes sense, as an assistant for structured content. Instead of generating free markup, AI produces structured data validated against schemas. Control stays in the architecture, not in the prompt.

**Benefit:** AI-assisted speed without AI-introduced inconsistency. Generated content is either valid and compliant, or it doesn't enter the system.
