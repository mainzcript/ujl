# Vision

## What is UJL?

**Unified JSON Layout (UJL)** is an open-source framework for visual content authoring on the web.

UJL provides a drag-and-drop editor where content can be created and maintained visually, without giving editors access to colors, spacing, typography, or semantic structure. Content can be composed and arranged freely, while design decisions remain systematically protected. Common mistakes with contrast, structure, or semantics are architecturally ruled out.

> **UJL separates content and design at the data level.**
> Editors work with content. Design rules are not in their hands.

Unlike traditional page builders that rely on freely editable HTML or CSS, UJL works with **structured data** that is validated against defined rules before rendering. Anything that can be built in the editor is, by definition, brand-compliant and accessible, within the guardrails you configure.

UJL is **not a CMS** and **not a platform**.
It is a **visual layout layer** that complements existing CMS and frontend systems without replacing them.

## The Problem

### 1. The Brand Compliance Dilemma

In almost every web project, the same structural conflict emerges. Editors want to create and maintain content quickly and independently. Designers need to ensure the corporate design is upheld. Developers end up caught between both sides, because every change requires their involvement.

Classical solutions shift the problem without solving it. Strict approval workflows prevent design errors but create long lead times and blocked teams. Visual page builders accelerate content creation but allow design freedoms that lead to drift and inconsistent brand presence over time. Manual controls are expensive, error-prone, and don't scale.

The result is a systemic trade-off: organizations must choose between speed and brand consistency.

### 2. AI Makes This Worse

AI-assisted content creation accelerates production further, and amplifies the governance problem. Generated content is often inconsistent, unreliable, and difficult to bind to brand rules. Even good models need repeated prompt context and can misunderstand or ignore constraints.

UJL addresses this by making AI generate **structured data** rather than free markup, data that is validated against schemas before it ever reaches users. Governance moves from the prompt to the architecture.

## What UJL Is Not

- Not a replacement for your CMS, UJL integrates with it
- Not a free-form page builder, design freedom stays within defined guardrails
- Not an AI service, UJL is AI-ready by design (structured data, stable schemas, embedding-ready fields), but ships without integrated AI models

## The Architecture

UJL enforces its guarantees through two mechanisms:

**Separation of content and design.** Content lives in `.ujlc.json`, design rules in `.ujlt.json`. Neither file can contain data from the other's domain. Theme updates propagate everywhere instantly. Editors never see design controls.

**Schema-first validation.** All documents are validated against Zod schemas at runtime. Invalid content, whether created by a human, imported from a CMS, or generated by an AI, is caught before it reaches users.

This makes compliance a property of the system, not a property of the process.
