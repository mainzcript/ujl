# UJL Documentation

This documentation website is organized into three main sections:

- **`about/`** - About UJL: Vision, target audiences, market positioning, and roadmap
- **`docs/`** - User Documentation: Getting Started, tutorials, API reference, examples (coming soon)
- **`arc42/`** - Architecture Documentation: Arc42-compliant architecture documentation for developers

The documentation serves as a central point of contact for all UJL users - from editors and designers to developers and architects.
